The Bayesian model evidence, or marginal likelihood, is a computationally challenging, yet crucial, quantity to estimate to perform Bayesian model comparison. We introduce a methodology to compute the Bayesian model evidence in simulation-based inference (SBI) scenarios (also often called likelihood-free inference). In particular, we leverage the recently proposed learnt harmonic mean estimator and exploit the fact that it is decoupled from the method used to generate posterior samples, i.e. it requires posterior samples only, which may be generated by any approach. This flexibility, which is lacking in many alternative methods for computing the model evidence, allows us to develop SBI model comparison techniques for the three main neural density estimation approaches, including neural posterior estimation (NPE), neural likelihood estimation (NLE), and neural ratio estimation (NRE). We demonstrate and validate our SBI evidence calculation techniques on a range of inference problems, including a gravitational wave example. Moreover, we further validate the accuracy of the learnt harmonic mean estimator, implemented in the HARMONIC software, in likelihood-based settings. These results highlight the potential of HARMONIC as a sampler-agnostic method to estimate the model evidence in both likelihood-based and simulation-based scenarios.","tags":["model comparison","simulation-based inference","Bayesian evidence","marginal likelihood","gravitational waves"],"title":"Bayesian model comparison for simulation-based inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Docherty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655893200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655893200,"objectID":"953ac2c0de3a929a19345ead5ca488e6","permalink":"https://mdochertyastro.github.io/talks/example/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/example/","section":"talks","summary":"Conference talk at BDL Paris.","tags":["Bayesian model comparison","simulation-based inference","gravitational waves"],"title":"Bayesian model comparison for simulation-based inference","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Jason D.

The marginal likelihood is a key component of Bayesian model selection since it is required to evaluate model posterior probabilities; however, its computation is challenging. The original harmonic mean estimator, first proposed in 1994 by Newton and Raftery, involves computing the harmonic mean of the likelihood given samples from the posterior. It was immediately realised that the original estimator can fail catastrophically since its variance can become very large and may not be finite. A number of variants of the harmonic mean estimator have been proposed to address this issue although none have proven fully satisfactory. We present the learnt harmonic mean estimator, a variant of the original estimator that solves its large variance problem. This is achieved by interpreting the harmonic mean estimator as importance sampling and introducing a new target distribution. The new target distribution is learned to approximate the optimal but inaccessible target, while minimising the variance of the resulting estimator. Since the estimator requires samples of the posterior only it is agnostic to the strategy used to generate posterior samples. We validate the estimator on a variety of numerical experiments, including a number of pathological examples where the original harmonic mean estimator fails catastrophically. In all cases our learnt harmonic mean estimator is shown to be highly accurate. The estimator is computationally scalable and can be applied to problems of dimension \\mathcal{O}(10^3) and beyond. Code implementing the learnt harmonic mean estimator is made publicly available.","tags":["harmonic mean estimator","model comparison","Bayesian evidence","marginal likelihood"],"title":"Machine learning assisted Bayesian model comparison: learnt harmonic mean estimator","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Coming soon…\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://mdochertyastro.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Coming soon…","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
