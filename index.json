The Bayesian model evidence, or marginal likelihood, is a computationally challenging, yet crucial, quantity to estimate to perform Bayesian model comparison. We introduce a methodology to compute the Bayesian model evidence in simulation-based inference (SBI) scenarios (also often called likelihood-free inference). In particular, we leverage the recently proposed learnt harmonic mean estimator and exploit the fact that it is decoupled from the method used to generate posterior samples, i.e. it requires posterior samples only, which may be generated by any approach. This flexibility, which is lacking in many alternative methods for computing the model evidence, allows us to develop SBI model comparison techniques for the three main neural density estimation approaches, including neural posterior estimation (NPE), neural likelihood estimation (NLE), and neural ratio estimation (NRE). We demonstrate and validate our SBI evidence calculation techniques on a range of inference problems, including a gravitational wave example. Moreover, we further validate the accuracy of the learnt harmonic mean estimator, implemented in the HARMONIC software, in likelihood-based settings. These results highlight the potential of HARMONIC as a sampler-agnostic method to estimate the model evidence in both likelihood-based and simulation-based scenarios.","tags":["Machine Learning","Numerical Methods","Software","Statistics","Simulation-based Inference"],"title":"Bayesian model comparison for simulation-based inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

In an expanding Universe the existence of causally separate regions prevents such symmetries from being broken uniformly, with a network of cosmic string inevitably forming as a result. To faithfully generate observables of such processes requires computationally expensive numerical simulations, which prohibits many types of analyses. We propose a technique to instead rapidly emulate observables, thus circumventing simulation. Emulation is a form of generative modelling, often built upon a machine learning backbone. End-to-end emulation often fails due to high dimensionality and insufficient training data. Consequently, it is common to instead emulate a latent representation from which observables may readily be synthesised. Wavelet phase harmonics are an excellent latent representations for cosmological fields, both as a summary statistic and for emulation, since they do not require training and are highly sensitive to non-Gaussian information. Leveraging wavelet phase harmonics as a latent representation, we develop techniques to emulate string induced CMB anisotropies over a 7.2 degree field of view, with sub-arcminute resolution, in under a minute on a single GPU. Beyond generating high fidelity emulations, we provide a technique to ensure these observables are distributed correctly, providing a more representative ensemble of samples. The statistics of our emulations are commensurate with those calculated on comprehensive Nambu-Goto simulations. Our findings indicate these fast emulation approaches may be suitable for wide use in, e.g., simulation based inference pipelines. We make our code available to the community so that researchers may rapidly emulate cosmic string induced CMB anisotropies for their own analysis.","tags":["harmonic mean estimator","model comparison","Bayesian evidence","marginal likelihood"],"title":"Fast emulation of anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background by cosmic strings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Docherty","Philippa Duckett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657880400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657880400,"objectID":"df3f8727ee71b15a1d3fef6c018b9340","permalink":"https://mmdocherty.github.io/talks/nlp_guest_lecture/","publishdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/nlp_guest_lecture/","section":"talks","summary":"Guest Lecture on Deep Learning for NLP for UCL ML Crash Course.","tags":["NLP","Deep Learning","Transformers"],"title":"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Matthew Docherty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657621200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657621200,"objectID":"e24e0a97595f26dd7e4cdafbb7b8ef7d","permalink":"https://mmdocherty.github.io/talks/jordan_summer_school/","publishdate":"2022-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/jordan_summer_school/","section":"talks","summary":"Overview of my 1st year PhD at international summer school.","tags":["Outreach","Science Communication"],"title":"UCL CDT in Data Intensive Science: A Year in Review","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Matthew Docherty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655893200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655893200,"objectID":"a1961bb8f92de7f73b6069161f0d84f8","permalink":"https://mmdocherty.github.io/talks/bdl_paris/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/bdl_paris/","section":"talks","summary":"Conference talk at BDL Paris.","tags":["Bayesian model comparison","simulation-based inference","gravitational waves"],"title":"Bayesian model comparison for simulation-based inference","type":"talks"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"coming soon…\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://mmdocherty.github.io/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"coming soon…","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Coming soon…\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://mmdocherty.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Coming soon…","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
